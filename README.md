# AgroWeather
AgroWeather is an AI Agriculture Android application specifically designed to optimize irrigation and spray operations using real-time weather information. Built with  Jetpack Compose and leveraging modern Android libraries, this app combines comprehensive weather data with AI-powered recommendations to help farmers make precise decisions about when and how to irrigate crops and apply sprays.

## Structural design pattern
The app is built with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) as its structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:

- **Models** hold application data. They're usually structs or simple classes.
- **Views** display visual elements and controls on the screen. They're typically subclasses of UIView.
- **View models** transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. They're usually classes, so they can be passed around as references.
